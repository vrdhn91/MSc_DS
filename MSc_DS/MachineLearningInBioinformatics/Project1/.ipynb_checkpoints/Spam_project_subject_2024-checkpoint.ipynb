    "The dataset and the article describing the dataset are in the whiteboard directory together with this notebook. Of note, the SMS messages have already been processed for ease of use: all punctuation marks have been removed and the text has been transformed into lowercase. It is also common practice to remove any stop words such as `a`, `as`, `the` and to perform stemming (reduce words to their base form, such as stripping  the final `s*` in plural words, or the `*ing` from verbs (e.g., running becomes run)). For the sake of simplicity, we did not do that in this exercise.\n",

    "\n",
    "The classification task is to predict for an SMS message if it is a _spam_ or a _ham_ (e.g. non-spam).\n",
